# Building & Installing

In order to build wmm, you must have gcc, xcb, and make available on your system.

  make clean
  make 
  make install

# Usage

## Basic wmm usage

In order to use wmm, simply put the following in your ~/.xinitrc:

   xterm &
   wmm

This will start an xterm, send that xterm to a background process, and then start wmm.

## Alternative wmm usage

You can use xbindkeys to make window manager agnostic key bindings for launching
processes. See `example_xinitrc` and `example_xbindkeysrc` for an example to bind
dmenu to Mod4+p (the default keybinding from dwm).

## Keybindings

Mod1/Alt + Right-click sends the active window to the bottom of the stack
This is the only keybinding in wmm
